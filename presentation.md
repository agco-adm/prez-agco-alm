## current state

* Manual process
  - Labor intensive
  - Ad-hoc and misaligned
  - Fail-prone and vulnerable

* Lots of red tape, difficulty in procuring access/tools

---

## goals
* automation
  -  builds, tests, metrics, deployments
* streamlined process/tools
  - easy setup, easy reviews
* easy to reproduce prod-like environments
  - ~~works on my machine~~
